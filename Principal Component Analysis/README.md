# Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear transformation technique that can be used for reduce dimensionality of a dataset. The goal is to explain the maximum amount of variance with the fewest number of principal components. PCA detect the correlation between variables, the dimensionality reduction than can be done based on how strong the correlation between them.

## Dataset Information

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset is diabetes patients records, diagnostic measurement and the information whether the patient had diabetes or not. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
